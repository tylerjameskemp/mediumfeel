                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>For the past year and a half, I've been trying a lot of AI stuff. Granola for meeting notes. Otto.ai for transcription. DiAL. New products from the frontier AI labs. Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini. I'm curious about new functionality.</p>

                    <p>The thing is, I'll see <mark>features that would be so useful, so close to what I need. But they don't address a broad enough audience's workflow, so they don't exist.</mark> Tools don't connect. I piece together workflows, but there's friction. Manual steps bridging the gaps.</p>

                    <p>The bigger issue: chat interfaces are fundamentally limiting. You type a question, get an answer, maybe iterate a few times. But you can't break free. You can't reshape how the technology works. You have no agency in how it's deployed.</p>

                    <p>This isn't new for me. When I was brand manager at Golden Road Brewing, we were under-resourced and scrappy. I focused on identifying problems and finding ways to solve them. Process refinements. Reducing friction. Being resourceful with what we had.</p>

                    <p>That's still how I work. I'm a PM and brand strategist. I'm a problem solver. I identify issues, think through processes, and come up with solutions.</p>

                    <p>Then I tried Claude Code. Within 48 hours, everything changed.</p>

                    <p>Claude Code with Opus 4.5. Running in Terminal.</p>

                    <p>I know. Another hyped AI tool. I was skeptical too.</p>

                    <p>But it felt different. Not a GUI promising to hide complexity. Not a visual builder with abstractions that break. Just a capable assistant in the terminal that could write code, explain decisions, debug with me, help me learn as I built.</p>

                    <p>More importantly: I could stay focused on <em>problems</em> instead of getting distracted by tools. <mark>I wasn't learning to use Claude Code. I was learning to think through problems in a way that lets me build solutions.</mark></p>

                    <p>That's the shift. For the first time in 18 months of AI hype, building something I actually needed felt <em>possible</em>. Not "someday possible." Not "if I learn to code properly first." Possible <em>now</em>, while staying focused on the problem I'm trying to solve.</p>

                    <p>Why now? Opus 4.5 is only a few months old. Every.to ran multiple posts about how profound the release was. Every AI podcast I follow spent episodes exploring what it meant. The context windows are bigger. The models actually understand code architecture, not just syntax. Something fundamental shifted.</p>

                    <p>I've been watching AI companies struggle with memory. ChatGPT Projects and NotebookLM show the power of working with larger document libraries, but they're limited.</p>

                    <p>I've been interested in RAG for a while. The idea of running local LLM models with my own data. A personal RAG system. Because I have so much data from my practice that's completely under-leveraged.</p>

                    <p>Client transcripts. Strategy sessions. Meeting notes. Research. Braindumps. <mark>Years of thinking that just sits in folders. Disconnected. Underutilized.</mark></p>

                    <p>When I work with larger document libraries in Cowork, it's immediately more powerful. That much data, accessible and connected. The possibility of tracking how strategy evolves. How concepts develop or fade. How ideas move from one project to another.</p>

                    <p>I constantly need to draw from multiple documents to distill brand voice, challenge decision-making, work through proposals and strategy docs. But the data is scattered. Disconnected. Underutilized.</p>

                    <p>I kept thinking: What would it look like to build something that helps me actually use all this data? Not a universal solution. Something specific to how I work. A personal knowledge system that tracks how my thinking evolves.</p>

                    <p>I decided to explore it. Not by imagining the perfect product. By building something small enough to test the ideas. A proof of concept around RAG, concept extraction, and tracking how ideas develop across documents.</p>

                    <p>Here's what changed: I wasn't just using Claude Code to write code. I was using it to think through <em>how</em> to build. To manage the build process itself.</p>

                    <p>I asked Claude how to scope a proof of concept. <mark>It suggested two weeks. I ended up building it in two days.</mark> But the framework mattered. Claude helped me structure the sprint. Create realistic schedules. Build in guardrails so I didn't spiral into feature creep or perfectionism.</p>

                    <p>This is where the agile methodology clicked for me in a new way. Daily standups with myself. Explicit "done" criteria for each piece. Time-boxed experiments. The technology wasn't just executing tasks. It was helping me manage my own process.</p>

                    <p>I learned about RAG by implementing it. Embeddings by generating them. Concept extraction by writing prompts and seeing what broke. Not by reading documentation. By doing, with a capable assistant helping me understand what I was building.</p>

                    <p>The POC I built (I'm calling it Weave) extracts concepts from documents and links similar ideas across files. It's rough. The transcript extraction is hilariously bad. The similarity matching needs tuning. But it works well enough to explore the ideas I was curious about.</p>

                    <p>This isn't about building a product. It's about learning to prototype my own thinking tools. About using the technology not just to build, but to guide the building process itself.</p>

                    <p>Chat interfaces are limiting. But building with these tools? That gives you agency. You can shape how the technology gets used. You can build the connective tissue between tools that never talk to each other.</p>
