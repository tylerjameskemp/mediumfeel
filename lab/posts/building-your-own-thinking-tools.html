                    <p>For eighteen months, I tried countless AI tools: Granola, Otter, Wispr Flow, Fathom, and Fireflies for meeting notes and transcription; Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity on the model front; Make and Zapier to connect data and build automations. I'm a PM and brand strategist, drawn to anything that might sharpen how I think through problems, and the temptation is always to take technology's bait, chasing features instead of focusing on the problems that undergird them.</p>

                    <p>The pattern was always the same: features that came <em>so close</em> to what I needed, yet never quite right. Tools that didn't connect. Manual steps bridging the gaps. Friction everywhere.</p>

                    <p>Chat interfaces are fundamentally limiting. You type a question, get an answer, iterate a few times, but you can't break free. You can't reshape how the technology works. You have no agency in how it's deployed. And product often pulls one over on us&mdash;we get sold a solution that doesn't address the problem we're actually trying to solve. A distraction dressed as progress.</p>

                    <p>Then I tried Claude Code. Within 48 hours, everything changed.</p>

                    <p>Not a GUI hiding complexity nor a visual builder with abstractions that break, but a capable assistant in the terminal that could write code, explain decisions, debug with me, and help me learn as I built. <mark>The shift wasn't learning a new tool&mdash;it was learning to think through problems in a way that lets me <em>build</em> the solutions.</mark></p>

                    <p>This is the paradigm change: as a problem solver, I can now describe exactly what I need and build the custom-tailored solution myself. Not wait for a product team to prioritize my use case. Not cobble together workarounds. Build.</p>

                    <p>For the first time in eighteen months of AI hype, that felt possible. Not "someday possible." Not "if I learn to code properly first." Possible <em>now</em>. Now the work is integrating that into how I think: rewiring my problem-solving instincts to include "I could build this" as a real option.</p>

                    <p>I have years of data from my practice that's completely under-leveraged: client transcripts, strategy sessions, meeting notes, research, braindumps. <mark>Years of thinking sitting in folders, disconnected and underutilized.</mark></p>

                    <p>I kept asking myself: what would it look like to build something that helps me actually use all this? Not a universal solution, but something specific to how I work. A personal knowledge system that tracks how my thinking evolves.</p>

                    <p>So I built it.</p>

                    <p>I asked Claude how to scope a proof of concept, and it suggested two weeks. I built it in two days. The framework mattered: daily standups with myself, explicit "done" criteria for each piece, time-boxed experiments. The technology wasn't just executing tasks; it was helping me manage my own process.</p>

                    <p>I learned about RAG by implementing it, embeddings by generating them, concept extraction by writing prompts and seeing what broke. Not by reading documentation, but by doing, with a capable partner explaining what I was creating along the way.</p>

                    <p>The proof of concept (I'm calling it Weave) extracts concepts from documents and links similar ideas across files. It's rough: the transcript extraction is hilariously bad, and the similarity matching needs tuning. Still, it works well enough to explore what I was actually curious about.</p>
