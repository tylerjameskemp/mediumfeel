                    <p>In the <a href="the-best-thing-claude-code-taught-me.html">last post</a>, I talked about the icebox: the list of every idea and feature I parked so I could stay focused on the proof of concept. Here&rsquo;s what was actually on it.</p>

                    <p>These weren&rsquo;t all features. They were mostly questions that kept showing up while I was supposed to be focused on something much smaller.</p>

                    <p>What if you could see how an idea develops across documents, not just where it appears, but how it changes shape over time?</p>

                    <p>What if it worked across multiple clients? Could you spot patterns that span different projects, the same strategic question showing up in different industries?</p>

                    <p>What if instead of searching for something when you need it, the system surfaced connections you hadn&rsquo;t thought to look for?</p>

                    <p>What if it could draft a brief based on everything it knows about a client, pulling from transcripts, notes, strategy docs, all of it?</p>

                    <p>Each one felt urgent when it came up. Each one went on the list.</p>

                    <p>When you look at what you wanted to build but didn&rsquo;t, it tells you what you&rsquo;re actually circling. And everything on my icebox pointed at the same thing: <mark>reducing the manual work of synthesis</mark>. Making relationships between ideas visible without having to hold all of it in your head.</p>

                    <p>If you&rsquo;ve ever pulled from five documents to write one brief, or held the connections between three client workstreams in your head because no tool surfaced them for you, that&rsquo;s the problem. That&rsquo;s what I do professionally. I just didn&rsquo;t expect to see it laid out so clearly in a side project.</p>

                    <p>The process byproducts were just as interesting. The questions I logged while building. The competitive research that was brutally honest about the market. The rabbit holes that didn&rsquo;t lead anywhere useful, but sharpened what I was actually asking.</p>

                    <p>Is this a product?</p>

                    <p>I did the research. The space is crowded. Enterprise companies are building custom solutions. The big AI labs keep making their chat interfaces more capable. A generic document tool doesn&rsquo;t differentiate.</p>

                    <p>But I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the right question. The proof of concept was never just about testing whether the ideas were worth exploring. It was testing whether <mark>building, actually making things, could become part of how I solve problems</mark>. Not just identify them, not just manage them, but build toward them.</p>

                    <p>And the icebox, the list of everything I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to chase, might be the clearest answer I got. The ideas are worth exploring. The questions are good. They just didn&rsquo;t come from reading about the market or thinking about it abstractly. They came from building something, watching it work and fail, and paying attention to what I wanted it to do next.</p>
